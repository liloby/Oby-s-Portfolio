                I graduated from UCLA majoring in Linguistics and
              Psychology where the learning environment is face-paced and
              challenging. Most recently, I was an assistant manager in a
              restaurant where it taught me not only customer satisfaction
              skills but I also took on a role to become a leader to work with
              my staff to upgrade the restaurantâ€™s health code from a B to an A.
              The experience shaped me to become an organized and detail
              oriented person who can follow and carry out instructions. Being
              in a managerial position also taught me how to adapt to a
              fast-paced and a slow-paced environment. Moving forward, I wish to
              apply the same commitment and skill set to continue to grow in a
              Software Development position and as an individual.
